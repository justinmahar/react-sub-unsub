## Overview

Easily subscribe to and from events in JavaScript.

When adding listeners, often you will need to remove that listener later. If you forget to do so, bugs or memory leaks may occur.

To simplify this pattern, you can use the `Subscribe` and `Subscriptions` classes in this library. When subscribing to an event, an unsubscribe function is returned. Calling this function will remove the listener.

There is built-in support for subscribing to [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) events and DOM object events, and support for events from any other listener interface.

This library also includes an easy way to unsubscribe all listeners at once with a single call, and is a perfect complement to React effects.

### Features include:

- **üîî Quickly and easily subscribe and unsubscribe to and from events**
  - An easy way to subscribe and unsubscribe from events in JavaScript.
- **‚öõÔ∏è Perfect for React effects**
  - Makes adding/removing listeners in React effects a breeze.
- **üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Covers common use cases, as well as custom ones**
  - Built-in support for [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) and DOM events, and custom.
- **üëç Simple, flexible, and convenient**
  - Use static functions yourself via `Subscribe`, or a `Subscriptions` instance for ultimate convenience.

## Installation

```
npm i subscribe-events
```

## Quick Start

Since it is a common use case, below is a full example of adding/removing listeners in React using the `Subscriptions` class.

In this example, we will subscribe to an event emitter, a DOM event, and a custom listener interface.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

import { Subscriptions } from 'subscribe-events';

export const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
export const MyComponent = (props) => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Listener functions
    const myEventListener = () => {
      console.log('My event fired!');
    };
    const keyPressListener = (e) => {
      console.log('Key pressed!', e);
    };
    const bodySizeListener = (e) => {
      console.log('Body size changed!', e);
    };

    // Use this object to subscribe and unsubscribe
    const subscriptions = new Subscriptions();

    // ‚û°Ô∏è Event emitter subscription
    subscriptions.subscribeEvent(eventEmitter, 'my-event', myEventListener);

    // ‚û°Ô∏è DOM event subscription
    subscriptions.subscribeDOMEvent(document, 'keypress', keyPressListener);

    // ‚û°Ô∏è Custom listener interface subscription
    subscriptions.subscribe(() => {
      const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(bodySizeListener);
      const targetElement = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
      resizeObserver.observe(targetElement);
      return () => resizeObserver.unobserve(targetElement);
    });

    // You can access all unsub functions directly, if you'd like
    console.log(`There are ${subscriptions.unsubs.length} subscriptions!`);

    // Unsubscribe all with one easy call!
    return () => subscriptions.unsubscribeAll();
  }, []);

  // ...

  return <div>My Component!</div>;
};
```

## Static Functions

If you'd like to call the functions used by `Subscriptions` manually, you can use the static functions available in the `Subscribe` class:

```js
import { Subscribe } from 'subscribe-events';
```

Call any of the following:

- `Subscribe.subscribe` - Call provided function to subscribe to an event and return an unsubscribe function.
- `Subscribe.subscribeEvent` - Subscribe to an emitter event and return an unsubscribe function.
- `Subscribe.subscribeDOMEvent` - Subscribe to a DOM event and return an unsubscribe function.
- `Subscribe.unsubscribeAll` - Call all provided unsubscribe functions (array or single unsubscribe).

See the JS docs for each for more details.
