## Overview

Easily subscribe to and from events in JavaScript.

When adding listeners, often you will need to remove that listener later. If you forget to do so, bugs or memory leaks may occur.

To simplify this pattern, you can use the `Subscribe` and `Subscriptions` classes in this library. They provide built-in support for subscribing to [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) events and DOM object events, and support for events from any other listener interface.

### Features include:

- **🔔 Quickly and easily subscribe and unsubscribe to and from events**
  - An easy way to subscribe and unsubscribe from events in JavaScript.
- **⚛️ Perfect for React effects**
  - Makes adding/removing listeners in React effects a breeze.
- **💁‍♀️ Covers common use cases, as well as custom ones**
  - Built-in support for [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) and DOM events, and custom.
- **👍 Simple, flexible, and convenient**
  - Use static functions yourself via `Subscribe`, or a `Subscriptions` instance for ultimate convenience.
